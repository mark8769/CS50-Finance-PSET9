# By defaut flask will bind to localhost a.k.a. 127.0.0.1 
# which is only accessible to process running on the same machine. 
# Docker containers are virtually different machines so only a process running 
# within the same container would be able to reach it.
# What you want to do is to tell flask to be reachable using the public ip of 
# the container (public to the docker network). Since you donâ€™t know which ip 
# address your container will be assigned within the docker subnetwork, 0.0.0.0 
# says to flask to accept incoming connections no matter the network adapter or the ip address.
